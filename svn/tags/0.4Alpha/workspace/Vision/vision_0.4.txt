IDP v.0.4 vision
=====================
1. Overview .
======================

1.1 Objectives.
-------------------------------

- Prototype should be able to process relatively simple change request, see examples in cr-examples directory.
- Prototype should be able to change at least 2 modules regarding the change request, for example class file and database table.

2. Main features.
==================

2.1 English language processing.
---------------------------------
The prototype is based on MontyLingua: Liu, Hugo (2004). MontyLingua: An end-to-end natural language processor with common sense. Available at: 
 `<web.media.mit.edu/~hugo/montylingua>`_.

2.2 Ontology.
--------------
The ontological representation of knowledge is based on owlapi. All the data required for the change request processing except for linguistic processing should be represented as knowledge-base in OWL.

3. Development.
=================
Development could be arranged in several steps:

1. Create Scala interface to jython application of MontyLingua.
2. Create Scala text processor based on MontyLingua sentence processing and further processing in the analogical way as in metafor by Hugo Liu.
3. Create mapping mechanisms in OWL
	- Language mapping
		* Java
		* SQL
	- Framework mapping
		* GWT ?
4. Create request based on CR text
5. Test
