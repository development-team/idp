= Things to be done in next version =

Nearest future:
  * Rename Cogitative layer to Perceiving layer.
  * Attach behaviour description to method of the module or to the module
  * Add an mechanism to modify the domain layer based on incoming information (teach the domain)
  * Add an option to generalize (create abstraction layers) of the domain(architecture of the application)
  * Add an option to generalize cogitative concepts

Far future:
  * Cogitation is the special domain and Linguistics is the special domain, have to have links that will enable the system to be much more flexible
